#Decanting

This Android app is currently under development. It will allow a user to play a simple puzzle game. The app will also feature a solver that will efficiently solve the puzzle through an efficient caching graph theory algorithm.

##Completed
* Solution solver, using a top-down dynamic programming approach by caching states through a BFS (Bread-First-Search) in a HashSet, such that you never revisit the same state.
* Basic game graphics, including buckets and swiping up and down to fill or empty buckets
* OOP architecture is mainly done

##In-Progress
* Proper menu design
* High-scores with SQLite database
